5. Branching

git branch -> show branch

git branch branch2 -> create branch named branch2

git checkout branch2 -> switch to branch2

git branch -d branch2 -> delete branch2

git push origin --delete branch2 -> delete branch remotely

// delete branch locally
git branch -d localBranchName

// delete branch remotely
git push origin --delete remoteBranchName
